It's a readme-file for a git project

We used next commands:

All conflicts are resolved

`git init`

`git add` -- add comment in future branch

`git commit`

`git status`

`git blame`

`git log`

`git diff`

`git branch`

`git checkout`

`git reset`

`git rm` -- deleting

It's a very simple system!

Now we'll try to push these changes to github!
